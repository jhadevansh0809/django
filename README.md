# django
I have started django recently

This is my first practice with django
I have completed my python using coursera courses(Python for everybody(Charles Severence)) and little bit of YouTube(Channel names:1.Code with Harry 2.Telusko)
Now I am focusing towards web development(specially in backend)


Thank You:)
